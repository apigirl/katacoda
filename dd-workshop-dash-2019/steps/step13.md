Congratulation, you just finished this workshop!

In this workshop, you created and deployed a brand new community integration.

If you want to go further, here are things you could try to do:
- Submit number of commits per contributors using tags.
  - How can you minimize the number of API calls?
- Add custom tags in your configuration
- Improve your tests in order to mock HTTP calls rather than the `PyGithub` Library objects.
  - The benefit of mocking HTTP calls is that you should not need to commit your GitHub access Token to have tests pass.
- Improve your dashboard.
  - Add top list contributors
