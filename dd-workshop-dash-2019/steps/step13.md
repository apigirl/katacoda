Congratulations, you just finished this workshop!

In this workshop, you created and deployed a brand new community integration.

If you want to go further, here are some other things to try:
- Submit the number of commits per contributors using tags.
  - How can you minimize the number of API calls?
- Add custom tags in your configuration.
- Improve your tests to mock HTTP calls rather than the `PyGithub` Library objects.
  - The benefit of mocking HTTP calls is that you should not need to commit your GitHub access token to have tests pass.
- Improve your dashboard.
  - Add a list of top contributors.
