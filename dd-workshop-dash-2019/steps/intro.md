Welcome to Build a Datadog Integration workshop

In this workshop, you will learn the steps to build a Datadog integration.

This is an advanced coding workshop.

During this workshop, you will code Python code and run bash commands. 

# Environment

The screen is divided into 3 panels:

## Instructions Panel
Located on the left is a sidebar. You can read the instructions for each step there.  
Complete the assignment defined in the "Goals" section. To help you complete the exercises, we provide a "Hints" and "Resources" section.

## User interface Editor Panel
The top section of the right side of the screen. 

You will be able to access all of the files and edit them. You can also create or delete files.
The editor is pointing at your workspace folder. This folder contains two folders:
- `integrations-extras`: this is the community repository where you will create your new integration.
- `solution`: This is where you will find our implementation of each step. This folder automatically refreshs as you are moving forward from one step to another.

## Terminal panel
The bottom section of the right side of the screen. 

This is where you will run all of your bash commands.
