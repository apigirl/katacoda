Congratulation, you just finished this workshop!

In this workshop, you created and deployed a brand new community integration.

# Optional

If you want to dig deeper here are improvements you could try to add to your integration:
- Submit number of commits per contributors
  - How can you minimize the number of API calls?
- Add custom tags in your configuration
- Improve your tests in order to mock http calls rather than the `PyGithub` Library objects.
- Improve your dashboard.
  - Add top list contributors
