# Getting Serious

This is the last section of this workshop and most probably the most challenging :)

Take this opportunity to improve your integration. 
We listed below ideas of improvements.

## Ideas
- Submit number of commits per contributors
  - How can you minimize the number of API calls?
- Add custom tags in your configuration
- Improve your tests in order to mock http calls rather than the `PyGithub` Library objects.
- Improve your dashboard.
  - Add top list contributors
